How it works
------------

On a 2.4 Linux, do:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
# insmod ./cacheinfo.o
# mkdir /cacheinfo 
# mount none /cacheinfo -t cinfofs
$ cinfo /lib/libc.so.6
/lib/libc.so.6: 182 of 272 (66.91%) pages in the cache, of which 0 (0.00%) are dirty

The cacheinfo project
---------------------

The goal of this project is to provide users with more information on the
contents of the various caches of their kernel. Having more information may
be useful to:
	
	- determine if adding more memory is useful

	- see if the cache is functioning as it should

	- find out if your files on the server are being cached or if other
	  files are deemed more important

It is suspected that better awareness of caches will improve people's
ability to build and maintain high performance servers and kernels.

What's there already
--------------------

A Linux 2.4 kernel module, cacheinfo.o which provides the cinfofs
filesystem. This filesystem acts as a gateway between the page cache, the
kernel and userspace. 

A small tool, cinfo, which queries this filesystem, if mounted on
/cacheinfo for information on a file.

Read the fine cinfo manpage for more information!

State of the project
--------------------

It is still very very early. Please help.
